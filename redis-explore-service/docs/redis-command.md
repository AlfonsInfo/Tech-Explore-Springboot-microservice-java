# What is Redis?
Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. This document provides a list of commands that can be used to interact with Redis.

## Redis Data Types
1. **String**: A simple key-value pair.
2. **Hash**: A collection of key-value pairs.
3. **List**: A collection of ordered values.
4. **Set**: A collection of unique values.
5. **Sorted Set**: A collection of unique values ordered by score.
6. **Bitmap**: A collection of bits.
7. **HyperLogLog**: A probabilistic data structure used to estimate the cardinality of a set.
8. **Geospatial Index**: A collection of geospatial points.
9. **Streams**: A collection of messages.
10. **Pub/Sub**: A message broker.
11. **Keyspace Notifications**: A mechanism for clients to receive events generated by the Redis server.
12. **Modules**: Extend Redis with new data types and commands.
13. **Transactions**: A group of commands that are executed as a single unit of work.
14. **Pipelining**: Send multiple commands to the server without waiting for the replies.

## Redis Commands
1. **SET key value**: Set the string value of a key.
2. **GET key**: Get the value of a key.
3. **DEL key**: Delete a key.
4. **EXISTS key**: Determine if a key exists.
5. **KEYS pattern**: Find all keys matching the given pattern.
6. **FLUSHALL**: Remove all keys from all databases.
7. **EXPIRE key seconds**: Set a key's time to live in seconds.
8. **TTL key**: Get the time to live for a key.
